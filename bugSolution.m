The issue lies in the fact that the `myString` property is retained by setting it, but the previous value is not released.  If `myObject.myString` is assigned to a value multiple times, the memory will be repeatedly retained and never released causing a double release error upon `dealloc`. Correct usage of `retain`, `release` and `autorelease` is essential in resolving this issue.  However, with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), introduced in modern Objective-C, this specific issue is significantly mitigated, as ARC automatically handles memory management.  However, understanding these principles is still important for troubleshooting and working with legacy code.

Here's a corrected version that addresses the memory management issue, although it's mostly relevant for pre-ARC projects.

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)setString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (myString != newString) {
        [myString release];
        myString = [newString retain];
    }
}

@end

//The solution uses setter and explicitly releases the old string before retaining the new one
```

In modern Objective-C with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), the issue of managing `retain` and `release` manually is avoided. ARC handles memory management automatically. However, this example demonstrates a common pitfall in manual memory management that developers should be aware of when working with older code bases.
